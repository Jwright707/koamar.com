# koamar.com

> Source for koamar.com site and blog

The old koamar.com site hasn't really been anything since it was started in 1996. Now, 24 years later, it will hopefully be something. This site will be based on Gatsby and most likely have a bit of the Tailwind CSS in there as well.

This is an experiment on learning and creating in public. Fun!

## Current Status

Very empty! The first koamar.com started on Dec 21 so I give myself at least until then to get something that doesn't look like a Gatsby Default Starter up here!

## Acknowledgments

Licensing ideas copied from [Dan Abramov's overreacted.io blog repo](https://github.com/gaearon/overreacted.io). I really like this idea! ðŸŽ‰ I did add one. You can tell because it is the one that doesn't make as much sense.
